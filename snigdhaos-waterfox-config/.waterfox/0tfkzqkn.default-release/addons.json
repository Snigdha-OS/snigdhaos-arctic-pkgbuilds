The browser extension upgrades your Firefox browser and supplies full adblock functionality, stops trackers from accessing your personal data, and annoying cookie consent pop-ups.\n\nGhostery has three main components:\n* Ad-Blocking - blocks all ads on websites you visit with your Firefox browser, including Youtube and Facebook, helping you to focus only on the information important to you.\n* Anti-Tracking - stops trackers’ ability to collect your personal data, replacing it with random values and anonymizing your identity for data brokers. If you see a need to unblock individual trackers, we developed this option. The reasons are up to you!\n* Never-Consent - automatically removes intrusive cookie popups and expresses dissent to online tracking. This unequaled feature adds convenience to each website visit and acts like your privacy advocate towards content providers while using Firefox.\n\nGhostery delivers the online privacy protection our users have come to know and love while minimising the need for customisation and maintenance.\n\nAs Ghostery is more than an ad-blocker, it comes with exceptional additional features, not found in any other ad-blocking extension:\n* Trackers information on any website your visit, informing you about the number of trackers, their type, and the company operating them.\n* Trackers Preview on search engine result pages - displaying tracker information even before you visit a page. You can safely make the choice to visit it, as Ghostery will stop trackers expecting you on the landing page.\n* WhoTracks.Me - Owning and operating the largest database of trackers allows Ghostery to update tracker information fast and reliably for all users.\n* Managing your adblock, antitracking, and cookie popup removal function in one click.\n\nMoreover, Ghostery is:\n* Open source\n* Supported by thousands of contributors worldwide\n* Free to use forever","weeklyDownloads":12675,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ghostery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10565426/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290017.png?modified=1700136255","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290017.jpg?modified=1700136255","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Tracker & Ad Blocker\r\nBrowser the web safer, faster and with less ads."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290018.png?modified=1700136253","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290018.jpg?modified=1700136253","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"No more annoying ads\r\nRemoves all advertising and promotional content from website you visit."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290019.png?modified=1700136252","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290019.jpg?modified=1700136252","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"No more cookie popups\r\nGhostery's feature \"Never-Consent\" automates the interaction with consent dialogs, expressing dissent to tracking."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290020.png?modified=1700136252","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290020.jpg?modified=1700136252","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Anti-Tracking technology\r\nGhostery blocks trackers, ads and popups making your browsing faster, safer and transparent."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2977,"reviewCount":1268,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/reviews/","updateDate":1713524726000},{"id":"sponsorBlocker@ajay.app","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-32.png?modified=d215907f","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-64.png?modified=d215907f","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-128.png?modified=d215907f"},"name":"SponsorBlock - Skip Sponsorships on YouTube","version":"5.5.9","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4251917/sponsorblock-5.5.9.xpi","homepageURL":"https://sponsor.ajay.app","supportURL":"https://sponsor.ajay.app","description":"Easily skip YouTube video sponsors.
